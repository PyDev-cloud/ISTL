								<h3>Bangladesh Immigration Visa On Arrival System</h3>
								<p>
                                    The project requirements of the Bangladesh Immigration Visa On Arrival (VOA) Management Information System included design, development and implementation, and deployment of an online and digital on-arrival visa providing and verification system that will verify and validate the arrival information, passport and other relevant information of the foreign immigrants who have applied for an on-arrival visa at the port of entry. Previously, the on –arrival visa processing was operated manually by the Special Branch of Bangladesh Police. The scope of the proposed system offers an online portal that will allow the user to apply for an on-arrival visa so that the entire process gets digitalized and computerized. Initially, the applicant has to upload all the necessary documents e.g. the valid passport, arrival information related documents in the portal for further verification. These information and relevant documents are then checked by the officer-in-charge and later sent to the field level officer for verification. The field level officer then performs verification process and uploads his/her feedback in the system. The applicant can always view the status of his application from the dashboard of the system. The scope also included a notification panel where the system always notifies the approval or disapproval of the application by sending email to the applicant within a predefined timeframe. The verification feedback is also sent to the e-gate system of Bangladesh airport that is integrated with the proposed VOA MIS so that the applicant can pass the e-gate and get permission to enter in the country. Due to recent pandemic situation, we are withholding the deployment of the system. As soon as the environment gets ready for deployment, we will initiate the process.

								<h3>Bangladesh RCMS AFIS</h3>
								<p>
                                    The project requirements included Supply, delivery and commissioning of an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) including necessary software, hardware and licenses by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). This system efficiently features one-to-one and one-to-many matching of a given biometric fingerprint input against the stored biometric records within the system. At the same time IOM RCMS AFIS features automated synchronization with the data sources of multiple stakeholder agencies connected with this system. As a result, this system always remains updated and for the deployment of specific identity instance management algorithms, the redundancy of de-duplication will be obsolete. In addition to that, a stand-alone AFIS Engine being a part of this project, the user of this system with proper access is able to adjust threshold for False Acceptance Ratio (FAR) and False Rejection Ratio (FRR) which even results better matching result.

								<h3>Bangladesh Prisoner Database Management System</h3>
								<p>
                                    The offered solution included development, implementation and management of a prison database management system for Bangladesh Prison Directorate to automate the prison operations and to create a digital information repository. The project also included an effective management of any prison system is dependent on the ability to collect, store, maintain and access information on individual prisoners. The number of persons held in custody, their classification, along with their health and rehabilitative needs provide important information for prison managers to identify resources requirements, set budgets, manage health and safety, and develop appropriate rehabilitative and treatment programmes. At headquarters level, the consolidation of the data of all prisoners is a critical policy-making tool in order to identify trends and address problem areas, such as the number of prisoners awaiting trial or the special needs of particularly vulnerable prisoners.
